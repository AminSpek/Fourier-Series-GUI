# Fourier-Series-GUI
Graphical User Interface (GUI) and Fourier Series in MATLAB速.

Fourier Series is a technique for expressing a periodic function by a linear combination in terms of sinusoid. The sinusoids can be real sinusoids of the form " A cos (w0t + q)" or they can be complex sinusoids of the form Aexp(jw0t) . In this course, students are exposed to computer-aided using MATLAB速 application software to compute the Fourier Series coefficient.

The objective is to design Graphical User Interface (GUI) and implement Fourier Series in MATLAB速.
